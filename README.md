# Defects4J Experimental Results

This repository contains **reproducible experimental results and scripts** based on the
[Defects4J](https://github.com/rjust/defects4j) benchmark.

The goal of this repository is to support **empirical studies in software testing and
automatic program repair (APR)** by providing collected results, execution scripts, and
configuration details.



## 1. Overview

Defects4J is a widely used benchmark of real-world Java bugs.
This repository records the **execution outcomes** of Defects4J experiments, including
test results and related metadata, to facilitate:

- Empirical analysis of software defects
- Evaluation of testing techniques
- Research on automatic program repair and test oracle behavior
- Reproducibility of experimental results
