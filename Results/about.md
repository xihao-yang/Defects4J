# About Results

This directory will store experimental results generated from running
the Defects4J benchmark.

At the current stage, no finalized results are included.
The structure and naming conventions are prepared for future experiments.

## Planned Result Types

Expected result types include, but are not limited to:

- Test execution outcomes (pass/fail)
- Logs generated during Defects4J runs
- Experiment-specific summaries

## File Naming Convention

Result files will follow the naming pattern: `<Project><BugID><ExperimentType>.*`

For example:

Lang_1_TestResults.log
Chart_12_PatchValidation.txt
